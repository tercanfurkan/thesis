\textbf{>> Recommendations to the case company}
\begin{itemize}
\item To investigate the adoption of more systematic reading techniques \cite{basiliCodeReading,porterCodeReading} in order to better understand and refactor code.
\item Possibilities for tool support should be explored. However, while detection of cases which offer a chance for refactoring can be automated, ensuring that is still best accomplished by having a person read the code.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Threads to Validity} \label{validity}
\subsection{Future Work} \label{future}
In this study, the first two steps of refactoring activities were discussed comparing the relevant literature and case study findings. 
\begin{itemize}
\item One interesting but challenging area would be to assess the effect of the applied refactoring solutions on quality characteristics of the software (e.g., complexity, understandability, maintainability) or the process (e.g., productivity, cost, effort).
\item One other interesting study would be to investigate the effect of applied refactorings in terms of lowering the cost of future changes to the code.
\item On other study would be investigating refactoring rationales applied by developers and track how their refactoring profile changes as they get more experience.
\end{itemize}
