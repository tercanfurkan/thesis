Present findings based on data collection and analysis. Discuss correlation with the literature findings.
\subsection{Identified refactoring rationales}
\subsubsection*{Algorithm change}
Improve code algorithm, remove excessive nesting, simplify complexity or add/remove additional parameters/libraries to improve understandability and robustness

\subsubsection*{Code formatting}
Improve code format â€“ remove/add blank lines, modify indentationl modify layout -  for better readability

\subsubsection*{Comments}
Add, remove or update line, method, class, general comments and pseudocode to improve understandability

\subsubsection*{Debugging}
Add, remove, update debugging related comments and logs, or any other improvements to help development

\subsubsection*{Decoupling}
Decouple tightly coupled classes by applying unidirectional associations, replacing inheritance with delegation to decrease intimacy or move method to correct class to limit feature envy, eventually achieve better decoupling and improved modularity

\subsubsection*{Delegate lazy class}
Delegate lazy class or method behavior to remove middle man or to remove dispensable code

\subsubsection*{Design inheritance}
improve inheritance misuse by making proper use of existing inheritance hierarchies, or using common interfaces to limit change Preventers, duplication and improve maintainability 

\subsubsection*{DevOps}
Any code improvement or configuration to help development and operational tasks

\subsubsection*{Encapsulation}
Redefine the scope of the class behavior and improve access rights

\subsubsection*{Extract method or class}
Divide large class or long method for readability and modularity

\subsubsection*{Modify code hierarchy}improve class, method, conditional structure by grouping code or other minor structure Changes to improve readability

\subsubsection*{Name change}
Changing variable, method, class, file, package naming to improve readability

\subsubsection*{Performance optimization}
Improve code algorithm and reduce computational complexity or add/remove additional parameters/libraries to improve performance

\subsubsection*{Remove dead code}
Remove any unused lines remaining in code due to legacy reasons, evolving software, changing functionality and refactoring

\subsubsection*{Replace data clumps with objects}
Wrap related data clumps into an object, use object orientation properly to reduce data clumps, long parameter list, large classes, long methods, primitive obsession and handle code more effectively 

\subsubsection*{Simplify speculative complexity}
Simplify code based on speculative generality, misunderstood requirements and over design

\subsubsection*{Unify code}
Create utility function based on duplicated code, generalize existing method behavior and serve similar requests, or use constants to remove duplicated code, limit change preventers and improve maintainability
