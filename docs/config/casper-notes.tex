My update:
literature review:
- contains 2 sections: refactoring reasons, how it perceives

- refactoring reasons are code smells of fowler, and anti-patterns from brown's book, several other reasons that overlap or extend the smells and anti-patterns

-how it is perceived is divided into to
- how it is conceptually perceived by developers, examined by going through surveys (what they know about refactoring, how important is it for them)
- how it is practices (there is more parameters to consider here, cost, time to market, project context, organizational behaviours)
